The myWebRTC application was developed during the summer semester 2014 and winter semester 2014-2015 (March 2014-March 2015) as a part of the Master course Business Computing in the Technical University of Applied Science TH Wildau [FH].   The inspiration came from the book of Johnston &amp; Burnett WebRTCbook.com.

Currently WebRTC is implemented in Chrome, Firefox and Opera browsers. Furthermore, it is supported from Android mobile platform but the present iOS App for Chrome on iPad and iPhone does not yet transfer voice and video data.

In order to run the JavaScript code you need to install Node.js (Download link: https://nodejs.org/)

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NonStop and IBM i. Moreover, Node.js contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server.

The application can be run by calling “node index.js 5001” on the Command Line (CMD)  after defining the path where the index.js file is located on your computer.
[ 5001 is the port you gave by default in the index.js file

var port = process.argv[2] || 5001; ]
